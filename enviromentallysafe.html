            <h3>Safety of nuclear fusion vs fission</h3>
            <p class = "Dankmeme">
                Compared to nuclear fission, nuclear fusion has little to none waste that is harmful to the environment in the long term. While fusion does indeed have waste, it is an indirect result of the reaction producing a 3.27-18.3 megaelectronvolt neutron/proton. What that neutron/proton hits will most likely be affected, but since fusion has not been replicated yet, there is no way to tell what will happen to what that electron/neutron hits. However, the problem will not be as long lasting as fission waste. On the other hand, fusion can help the production of helium, which is a limited resource on earth. Nuclear fission produces waste during each part of the fuel cycle. Nuclear waste can be toxic and radoactive. Radoiactive wastes can affect DNA and cellular repair functions, altering the cell cycle, forming mutations in the G1 phase. Radioactive waste also takes a very long time to decay into smaller and more stable atoms. The chemical and radioactive sludge can, if not sealed and blocked off properly, go into underwater water sources which are <i>very</i> important in certain areas. That toxicity can also alter ecosystems depending on where the water sources are.
