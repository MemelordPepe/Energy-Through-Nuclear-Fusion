        <h3>Nuclear Fusion in Stars</h3>
        <p>Nuclear fusion is the driving force in a star that produces light and radiation. It is also what causes the demise of stars of a certain age and size. This fusion occurs in the “core” of every star. In our Sun, the core is approximately a quarter of the radius of the entire celestial body. It is in the core of young stars that hydrogen nuclei merge to form helium. This reaction takes place due the immense heat in the center of our Sun; the core temperature of our sun being 15.7 million degrees Kelvin or 28 million degrees fahrenheit. In this reaction, the excess product is a neutron and energy which can take the form of photons(particles of light). The energy produced comes from a portion of the mass of hydrogen that has been converted to this new form. We use Albert Einstein's famous equation, E=mc2, to predict exactly how much energy one can get from some mass. The “E” in the equation stands for energy, the “m” stands for mass, and the “c” stands for celeritas or the speed of light. Although the mass that is converted is quite small, it produces HUGE amounts of energy due to the fact that the speed of light a massive number that is being squared when calculating how much energy is to be released.</p>
