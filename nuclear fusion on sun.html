        <h3>Nuclear Fusion in Stars</h3>
        <p>Nuclear fusion is the driving force in a star that produces light and radiation. It is also what causes the demise of stars of a certain age and size. This fusion occurs in the “core” of every star. In our Sun, the core is approximately a quarter of the radius of the entire celestial body. It is in the core of young stars that hydrogen nuclei merge to form helium. This reaction takes place due the immense heat in the center of our Sun; the core temperature of our sun being 15.7 million degrees Kelvin or 28 million degrees fahrenheit. In this reaction, the excess product is a neutron and energy which can take the form of photons(particles of light). The energy produced comes from a portion of the mass of hydrogen that has been converted to this new form. We use Albert Einstein's famous equation, E=mc2, to predict exactly how much energy one can get from some mass. The “E” in the equation stands for energy, the “m” stands for mass, and the “c” stands for celeritas or the speed of light. Although the mass that is converted is quite small, it produces HUGE amounts of energy due to the fact that the speed of light a massive number that is being squared when calculating how much energy is to be released.</p>
        <p>Now, going back to a previously stated item, how does fusion cause the death of stars? In the core of stars, nuclei don’t stop merging at helium; they continue to combine and form larger and larger elements. Once the star is old enough to start making iron, one of the more stable nuclei, it requires more energy to fuse nuclei than energy released. At this point the core temperature drops and the star runs out of elemental fuel. Then for a brief time the star goes supernova and expands as the temperature climb higher than a stable star. And finally, the star will explode, expelling its elemental guts into empty space.</p>
        <h3>How do we know?</h3>
        <p>The primary method of observing nuclear fusion on stars was discovering by Cecilia Payne. She devised a way to examine the temperatures and elemental composition by making use of a star’s spectrum of light. She made use of the discovery by Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen that every element gives off a specific color on the visible light spectrum when exposed to a flame. Knowing this, Payne used her data to determine what color light was given off where in the star. By viewing this, one could tell the age of a star as well as track the progression of nuclear fusion in the core.</p>
