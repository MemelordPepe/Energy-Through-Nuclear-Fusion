            <h3>Production of Energy in Nuclear Fusion</h3>
            <p> The energy produced during the process of nuclear fusion originates with the free neutron that is a produced. A small portion of this mass is converted to pure energy; although a single neutron only has a mass of approximately 1.67x10-24 grams, a significant amount of energy is yielded. We know this now because of Albert Einstein’s work in special relativity. He discovered an equation that describes the conversion of mass to energy, E=mc2. Extremely small masses can be converted into large amounts of energy due to the fact that the speed of light, “c”, is a massive number that is being squared.</p>
            <h3>Effects of Nuclear Energy on Earth</h3>
            <p>The reason the scientific community is so enthused about nuclear fusion is because it is an excellent alternative energy source than fossil fuels and fission energy. The use of fossil fuels causes companies to search for and harvest materials and that can cause environmental catastrophes like the the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The materials necessary for nuclear fusion (tritium,deuterium, and lithium) are all abundant on Earth and can be found in ocean water and rocks. Nuclear fusion would be a better energy source than fission because there is no risk of a meltdown due to the fact that fusion is not a chain reaction and there is no long-term radioactive waste like in fission. Between the abundance of materials, which would abate national tension over rare materials, fewer concerns for safety of the masses, and the clean energy produced, nuclear fusion is projected to be a large factor in energy production in the near future.</p>
