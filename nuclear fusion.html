    <p id= "2">Our group consists of three members who excell in different areas. Erick is an aspiring astro-physicist with a passion for varying topics of science. He also plays in the school's top orchestra and plays both football and baseball. Erick has handled a majority of gathering of information and has done a small amount of the coding required for the project. Jonny is hoping to become a game designer. Thus, he has handled a large bulk of the game design for the project.</p>
