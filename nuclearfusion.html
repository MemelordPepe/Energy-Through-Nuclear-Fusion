    <p class="Dankmeme">Our group consists of three members who excell in different areas. Erick is an aspiring astro-physicist with a passion for varying topics of science. Erick has handled a majority of the gathering of information and has done a small amount of the coding required for the project. Jonny is hoping to become a game designer. Thus, he has handled a large bulk of the game design for the project. Jontae, the final group member, has a strong background in coding and has handled most of the aesthetics for the site. This variety of skills has proven very beneficial in the production of our project. We hope you enjoy!</p>
    <h3 class="Pepe">About the Project</h3>
    <p class="Dankmeme">We were assigned a project in which the only rule was that it had to be related to something nuclear. As you can see, we decided to make a website due to the talents of our memebers. Our topic of discusion is the production of nuclear energy through fusion on the sun and on Earth.</p></p>
