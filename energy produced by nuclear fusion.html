            <h3>Production of Energy in Nuclear Fusion</h3>
            <p> The energy produced during the process of nuclear fusion originates with the free neutron that is a produced. A small portion of this mass is converted to pure energy; although a single neutron only has a mass of approximately 1.67x10-24 grams, a significant amount of energy is yielded. We know this now because of Albert Einstein’s work in special relativity. He discovered an equation that describes the conversion of mass to energy, E=mc2. Extremely small masses can be converted into large amounts of energy due to the fact that the speed of light, “c”, is a massive number that is being squared.</p>
