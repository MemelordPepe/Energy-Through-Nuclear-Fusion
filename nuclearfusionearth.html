            <h3>Complications of Nuclear Fusion on Earth</h3>
            <p>Nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two nuclei near each other at high speeds to produce a single atom, a free neutron, and energy. When the two nuclei become close enough to overcome the nuclear forces that repel protons from each other; at this point, the force of repulsion becomes the force that pulls together the nuclei to form one atom. The immense velocity of the nuclei is credited to the tremendous heat of its surroundings. This is easily understood by looking at a simple, everyday occurrence on Earth called melting. This transition in state of matter takes place because the atoms of the substance at hand are absorbing the energy of the heat and begin to move more freely and energetically. The same occurs in nuclear fusion. The nuclei absorb the energy-rich heat of its environment and move about in increasing speeds until the circumstances are right to combine with another, equally vivacious nuclei.The problem in replicating nuclear fusion on Earth lies in the fact that by normals means, it is extremely difficult to create temperatures high enough to promote the fusion of nuclei.</p>
            <h3>Attempts of Nuclear Fusion on Earth</h3>
            <p>As previously stated, the struggle in true nuclear fusion on Earth is the incredible heat required. The only successful method of this “true” nuclear fusion is with the aid of its opposite, nuclear fission. Unlike fusion, fission is the splitting of an unstable atom to release a tremendous amount of heat and energy. And more so, it is easier to achieve than fusion(simply by overloading a nucleus with neutrons until it splits). Thus, scientists developed bombs in which there were two “compartments”. The first is a forced fission of an atom that will, in turn, produce enough heat to promote the fusion of hydrogen in the juxtaposed compartment.</p>
            <p>Efforts in reproducing nuclear fusion without weaponization have also been underway. These endeavors were undergone in the attempt to harness the energy released from fusion, because it is greater than that of fission. As of now there are two main methods in use to achieve the goal of nuclear fusion. The first is a reactor that works by magnetic confinement. In these reactors, the exceedingly hot plasma that creates great temperatures is restricted from coming in contact with the container- because it would surely melt any material on Earth- by strong magnetic fields that force the plasma in a looping, circular path. The greatest temperature reached by this reactor is recorded at 5.1 x 108 degrees Kelvin. The second method of fusion is through inertial confinement. This idea is centered around the idea that if you provide a great enough influx of energy is a short enough time frame, nuclei won’t have time the move apart due to their inertia. Instead, they will be forced to combine. It is the opinion of many scientists that nuclear fusion will soon be possible and widely used as an energy source if progress continues.</p>
